      "there is also [Calzone](https://github.com/michal-h21/calzone), which unfortunately doesn't preserve formatting. I've [forked it](https://github.com/michal-h21/calzone), removed jQuery dependency, so it is faster now and tried to preserve the formatting. It works sometimes, sometimes it fails. I am not DOM nor JS expert, so I don't really know what's the issue, maybe you might have better luck?"
