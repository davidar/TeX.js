      "> I have enabled a first preview over our arXiv HTML sources that uses TeX.js now\r\n\r\nAwesome! :D\r\n\r\n> It seems a bit awkward, probably due to the iframe, there is a bit too much going on in that page now. I'll consider refactoring to a separate preview page without an iframe, so that things are simpler. Another note is that originally the main.css rule for body was adding a display: none; that was never removed, which was giving me blank previews. I overwrote it by hand for now.\r\n\r\nHmm, it looks like TeX.js isn't loading properly. I suspect it isn't interacting well with the way you're dynamically loading the content. Would you be able to generate the previews server-side? Otherwise I can try to work out how to make TeX.js play nicer."
