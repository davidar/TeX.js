      "If I could have a wish for a TeX.js improvement, it would be to become independent of any of the ready events, so that I can just add it after a dynamically loaded set of assets and tell it \"render this\". MathJax has evolved over time to have a \"Rerender()\" method, among others, exactly to facilitate dynamic use cases. But I'm already happy I have the rendering working well!\r\n\r\nFWIW, the reason I mentioned patience with loading was that 1) I am using a throttled Starbucks wifi connection and 2) I seem to need to fire a ready event twice by hand, before the full TeX.js dependency chain gets loaded.
